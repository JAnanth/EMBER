<span style="font-size:5em;">Welcome to the EMBER Source Code</span>
<span style="font-size:2em;">
  This folder contains all of the code and data that went into the development of EMBER. The folder has two subfolders that separate the code and data. Within the code folder, there are two folders: final and testing_versions. The final folder has all of the documented classes in a format that is more organized and easier to follow. If you would like to see more about the process of developing EMBER and some of the code that was used in initial stages, you can look at the testing_versions where each component is organized into subfolders. Keep in mind, though, that much of the testing versions code is undocumented and a bit harder to follow. If you would like more information about EMBER, its inspiration, the development process, and future plans, feel free to check out a 10-minute video that explains the project a bit more:
